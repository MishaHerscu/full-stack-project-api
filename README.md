This is the README for the server for my first full stack web application.

The application will be a way for my friends and I to track the performance
of the teams and players in a recreational [goaltimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltimate) league.

-   The server will store the information about the players and teams.
-   The client will provide the UX.

Planning materials include:
